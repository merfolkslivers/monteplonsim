# monteplonsim
~~5~~ 10 hour dev jam for figuring out odds of a certain event in [Cardfight Vanguard](https://en.cf-vanguard.com/).
I got bored one day and wanted to know how badly (or not, actually) an 8/8/17 Plon build would function, but didn't feel like pulling out Excel and trying to figure out hypergeometric odds and building a state tree.
It's vaguely Monte Carlo using a set of priority lists for the Melody searchers (Cier/Mipu) to pick up.
Special thanks to [Frank Karsten](https://twitter.com/karsten_frank) for being my spirit animal and inspiring me to do this jam.
